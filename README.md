This is a collection of algorithms for programming contests such as codeforces and AtCoder.
This can compile with version 1.15.1 so that you can use it with the old compiler in AtCoder.

Currently, it supports a few basic data structures and functions.
* Binary Indexed Tree
* Union-Find (Disjoint Set)
* ModInt (automatically computes mod N with several operations)
* Combinations
* Next/Prev Permutation
* Xorshift random generator
* Segment tree (experimental)
